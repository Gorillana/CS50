// after using the different algorithms on the data these were my findings:

sort1 uses: bubble sort

How do you know?: Faster with sorted data

sort2 uses: merge sort

How do you know?: Overall faster than other sorting files

sort3 uses: selection sort

How do you know?: Significantly slower with sorted data than sort1 or sort2
